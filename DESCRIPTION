Description: Mixed, low-rank, and sparse multivariate regression ('mixedLSR') provides tools for performing mixture regression when 
  the coefficient matrix is low-rank and sparse. 'mixedLSR' allows subgroup identification by alternating optimization 
  with simulated annealing to encourage global optimum convergence. This method is data-adaptive, automatically 
  performing parameter selection to identify low-rank substructures in the coefficient matrix.
